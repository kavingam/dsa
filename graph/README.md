Graph theory is a branch of mathematics concerned with the study of networks of points, called vertices or nodes, connected by lines or curves, called edges.

**Graph theory:** vertices and edges

Vertices can represent many things, such as cities, people, computers, or any other objects that can be connected. Edges can represent connections or relationships between the vertices.

Graph theory has its origins in the 18th century with the Königsberg Bridge Problem. The problem asked whether it was possible to walk through the city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) and cross each of its seven bridges exactly once.  Leonhard Euler proved that this was not possible, and his work is considered to be the first published work in graph theory.

Graph theory has many applications in computer science, operations research, social sciences, and other fields. Some of the common applications of graph theory include:

* Modeling computer networks
* Routing algorithms
* Scheduling problems
* Social network analysis
* Game theory
